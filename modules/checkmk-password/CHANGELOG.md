## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial module: reads one field of a 1Password item (by title, section and field label) and stores it as a `checkmk_password` Password Store entry, using the community provider `registry.terraform.io/blackmesaltd/checkmk` (v0.0.5, pinned exactly). The secret is never an output; `password_id` is validated against Checkmk's identifier rules; an offline `tofu test` (mocked providers) covers the lookup and the validation.
